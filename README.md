# mtg-shuffle
A collection of small Python scripts that can be used to explore various card shuffling techniques.

## Usage instructions
Edit config.ini and configure_shuffler.py to your tastes.

Note that there's basically no UI around any of this, and it should be viewed more as a collection of small, potentially
useful standalone scripts.
